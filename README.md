This project will be a simple webpage of recipes!

When I have completed this project, I will be able to demonstrate skills in HTML such as implementation of the HTML5 boilerplate, implementation of various HTML elements, and implementation of various HTML attributes. These will include paragraphs and images. I will also display organization of my website's files and webpages.
